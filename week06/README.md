#### HW for Wednesday 3/4
* Code Exercise: [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
* Midterm project concept + design strategy sites due in class

#### Midterm Project
Think of a topic or issue to create a website for. Perhaps it is something you have researched + written on in the past that you want to re present in multimedia interactive form. Perhaps it is related to an organization you are afflicted with outside of school. Perhaps you want to create a net art piece. Try to think outside the box - there are millions of websites - what makes this project unique? 

A design strategy including a detailed wireframe of your home page (I will be looking for consideration of grid systems, thoughtful color selection, typography, UX, etc) and a basic sitemap.

###### Technical Parameters:
* Semantic HTML
* Responsive CSS in an External Style sheet
* Use of Flex and / or Grid display
