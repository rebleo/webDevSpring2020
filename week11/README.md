##### Assignment: Pair programming project
This is an exercise in pair programming + rapid prototyping. Come up with ideas for a site / app to be built using JQuery. Be prepared to spend time on Monday working with your partner + creating a collaborative project pitch presentation. On Wednesday pairs will pitch their ideas + get feedback from the class. You will then have the rest of Wednesday to work with your partner + check in with Rebecca. We can also use this time to do optional one-on-one check-ins. You'll present + critique each pair's projects on Monday the 20th.
###### For Wednesday: project proposal - slide deck including:
  * Site / App Concept
  * Wireframe
  * Basic site map
  * Design strategy
  * Specific JQUery Functions y'all plan to utilize
  * Both members of the team have to speak to some points of the process.
  * Post a link to your slidedeck [here](https://github.com/rebleo/webDevSpring2020/wiki/Week-11#pair-projects-proposals) before the start of class on Wednesday.
