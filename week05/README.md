##### HW for Monday
* Read: [Society of the Spectacle Ch 1](debord.html) 
* Using Flexbox + other HTML/CSS concepts from the last few weeks create a thoughtfull designed three page website that responds to the above reading. You can think of this as a traditional written response - or using the logic of grids, text + images, a creative response. If you get stuck, maybe pull some language from the reading to frame your site. Be prepared to discuss your design desicions in class on Monday.
