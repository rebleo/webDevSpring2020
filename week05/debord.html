<h4>Chapter 1 &#8220;Separation Perfected&#8221;</h4>
<p class="quoteb">But certainly for the present age, which prefers
the sign to the thing signified, the copy to the original,
representation to reality, the appearance to the essence... illusion
only is sacred, truth profane. Nay, sacredness is held to be enhanced
in proportion as truth decreases and illusion increases, so that the
highest degree of illusion comes to be the highest degree of
sacredness. <br />
Feuerbach, Preface to the second edition of The Essence of Christianity</p>
<h5>1.</h5>
<p class="fst">
In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life
presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything
that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.<br>
<h5>2.</h5>
<p>The images detached from every aspect of life fuse in a common
stream in which the unity of this life can no longer be reestablished.
Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own general unity, as a
pseudo-world apart, an object of mere contemplation. The specialization
of images of the world is completed in the world of the autonomous
image, where the liar has lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as
the concrete inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the
non-living.</p>
<h5>3.</h5>
<p>The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as all of society, as
part of society, and as instrument of unification. As a part of society
it is specifically the sector which concentrates all gazing and all
consciousness. Due to the very fact that this sector is separate, it is
the common ground of the deceived gaze and of false consciousness, and
the unification it achieves is nothing but an official language of
generalized separation.</p>
<h5>4.</h5>
<p>The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation
among people, mediated by images.</p>
<h5>5.</h5>
<p>The spectacle cannot be understood as an abuse of the world of
vision, as a product of the techniques of mass dissemination of images.
It is, rather, a Weltanschauung which has become actual, materially
translated. It is a world vision which has become objectified.</p>
<h5>6.</h5>
<p>The spectacle grasped in its totality is both the result and the
project of the existing mode of production. It is not a supplement to
the real world, an additional decoration. It is the heart of the
unrealism of the real society. In all its specific forms, as
information or propaganda, as advertisement or direct entertainment
consumption, the spectacle is the present model of socially dominant
life. It is the omnipresent affirmation of the choice already made in
production and its corollary consumption. The spectacle&#8217;s form and
content are identically the total justification of the existing
system&#8217;s conditions and goals. The spectacle is also the permanent
presence of this justification, since it occupies the main part of the
time lived outside of modern production.</p>
<h5>7.</h5>
<p>Separation is itself part of the unity of the world, of the global
social praxis split up into reality and image. The social practice
which the autonomous spectacle confronts is also the real totality
which contains the spectacle. But the split within this totality
mutilates it to the point of making the spectacle appear as its goal.
The language of the spectacle consists of signs of the ruling
production, which at the same time are the ultimate goal of this
production.</p>
<h5>8.</h5>
<p>One cannot abstractly contrast the spectacle to actual social
activity: such a division is itself divided. The spectacle which
inverts the real is in fact produced. Lived reality is materially
invaded by the contemplation of the spectacle while simultaneously
absorbing the spectacular order, giving it positive cohesiveness.
Objective reality is present on both sides. Every notion fixed this way
has no other basis than its passage into the opposite: reality rises up
within the spectacle, and the spectacle is real. This reciprocal
alienation is the essence and the support of the existing society.</p>
<h5>9.</h5>
<p>In a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the
false.</p>
<h5>10.</h5>
<p>The concept of spectacle unifies and explains a great diversity of
apparent phenomena. The diversity and the contrasts are appearances of
a socially organized appearance, the general truth of which must itself
be recognized. Considered in its own terms, the spectacle is
affirmation of appearance and affirmation of all human life, namely
social life, as mere appearance. But the critique which reaches the
truth of the spectacle exposes it as the visible negation of life, as a
negation of life which has become visible.</p>
<h5>11.</h5>
<p>To describe the spectacle, its formation, its functions and the
forces which tend to dissolve it, one must artificially distinguish
certain inseparable elements. When analyzing the spectacle one speaks,
to some extent, the language of the spectacular itself in the sense
that one moves through the methodological terrain of the very society
which expresses itself in the spectacle. But the spectacle is nothing
other than the sense of the total practice of a social-economic
formation, its use of time. It is the historical movement in which we
are caught.</p>
<h5>12.</h5>
<p>The spectacle presents itself as something enormously positive,
indisputable and inaccessible. It says nothing more than &#8220;that which
appears is good, that which is good appears. The attitude which it
demands in principle is passive acceptance which in fact it already
obtained by its manner of appearing without reply, by its monopoly of
appearance.</p>
<h5>13.</h5>
<p>The basically tautological character of the spectacle flows from the
simple fact that its means are simultaneously its ends. It is the sun
which never sets over the empire of modern passivity. It covers the
entire surface of the world and bathes endlessly in its own glory.</p>
<h5>14.</h5>
<p>The society which rests on modern industry is not accidentally or
superficially spectacular, it is fundamentally spectaclist. In the
spectacle, which is the image of the ruling economy, the goal is
nothing, development everything. The spectacle aims at nothing other
than itself.</p>
<h5>15.</h5>
<p>As the indispensable decoration of the objects produced today, as
the general expose of the rationality of the system, as the advanced
economic sector which directly shapes a growing multitude of
image-objects, the spectacle is the main production of present-day
society.</p>
<h5>16.</h5>
<p>The spectacle subjugates living men to itself to the extent that the
economy has totally subjugated them. It is no more than the economy
developing for itself. It is the true reflection of the production of
things, and the false objectification of the producers.</p>
<h5>17.</h5>
<p>The first phase of the domination of the economy over social life
brought into the definition of all human realization the obvious
degradation of being into having. The present phase of total occupation
of social life by the accumulated results of the economy leads to a
generalized sliding of having into appearing, from which all actual
&#8220;having&#8221; must draw its immediate prestige and its ultimate function. At
the same time all individual reality has become social reality directly
dependent on social power and shaped by it. It is allowed to appear
only to the extent that it is not.</p>
<h5>18.</h5>
<p>Where the real world changes into simple images, the simple images
become real beings and effective motivations of hypnotic behavior. The
spectacle, as a tendency to make one see the world by means of various
specialized mediations (it can no longer be grasped directly),
naturally finds vision to be the privileged human sense which the sense
of touch was for other epochs; the most abstract, the most mystifiable
sense corresponds to the generalized abstraction of present-day
society. But the spectacle is not identifiable with mere gazing, even
combined with hearing. It is that which escapes the activity of men,
that which escapes reconsideration and correction by their work. It is
the opposite of dialogue. Wherever there is independent representation,
the spectacle reconstitutes itself.</p>
<h5>19.</h5>
<p>The spectacle inherits all the weaknesses of the Western
philosophical project which undertook to comprehend activity in terms
of the categories of seeing; furthermore, it is based on the incessant
spread of the precise technical rationality which grew out of this
thought. The spectacle does not realize philosophy, it philosophizes
reality. The concrete life of everyone has been degraded into a
speculative universe.</p>
<h5>20.</h5>
<p>Philosophy, the power of separate thought and the thought of
separate power, could never by itself supersede theology. The spectacle
is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion. Spectacular
technology has not dispelled the religious clouds where men had placed
their own powers detached from themselves; it has only tied them to an
earthly base. The most earthly life thus becomes opaque and
unbreathable. It no longer projects into the sky but shelters within
itself its absolute denial, its fallacious paradise. The spectacle is
the technical realization of the exile of human powers into a beyond;
it is separation perfected within the interior of man.</p>
<h5>21.</h5>
<p>To the extent that necessity is socially dreamed, the dream becomes
necessary. The spectacle is the nightmare of imprisoned modern society
which ultimately expresses nothing more than its desire to sleep. The
spectacle is the guardian of sleep.</p>
<h5>22.</h5>
<p>The fact that the practical power of modern society detached itself
and built an independent empire in the spectacle can be explained only
by the fact that this practical power continued to lack cohesion and
remained in contradiction with itself.</p>
<h5>23.</h5>
<p>The oldest social specialization, the specialization of power, is at
the root of the spectacle. The spectacle is thus a specialized activity
which speaks for all the others. It is the diplomatic representation of
hierarchic society to itself, where all other expression is banned.
Here the most modern is also the most archaic.</p>
<h5>24.</h5>
<p>The spectacle is the existing order&#8217;s uninterrupted discourse about
itself, its laudatory monologue. It is the self-portrait of power in
the epoch of its totalitarian management of the conditions of
existence. The fetishistic, purely objective appearance of spectacular
relations conceals the fact that they are relations among men and
classes: a second nature with its fatal laws seems to dominate our
environment. But the spectacle is not the necessary product of
technical development seen as a natural development. The society of the
spectacle is on the contrary the form which chooses its own technical
content. If the spectacle, taken in the limited sense of &#8220;mass media&#8221;
which are its most glaring superficial manifestation, seems to invade
society as mere equipment, this equipment is in no way neutral but is
the very means suited to its total self-movement. If the social needs
of the epoch in which such techniques are developed can only be
satisfied through their mediation, if the administration of this
society and all contact among men can no longer take place except
through the intermediary of this power of instantaneous communication,
it is because this &#8220;communication&#8221; is essentially unilateral. The
concentration of &#8220;communication&#8221; is thus an accumulation, in the hands
of the existing system&#8217;s administration, of the means which allow it to
carry on this particular administration. The generalized cleavage of
the spectacle is inseparable from the modern State, namely from the
general form of cleavage within society, the product of the division of
social labor and the organ of class domination.</p>
<h5>25.</h5>
<p>Separation is the alpha and omega of the spectacle. The
institutionalization of the social division of labor, the formation of
classes, had given rise to a first sacred contemplation, the mythical
order with which every power shrouds itself from the beginning. The
sacred has justified the cosmic and ontological order which
corresponded to the interests of the masters; it has explained and
embellished that which society could not do. Thus all separate power
has been spectacular, but the adherence of all to an immobile image
only signified the common acceptance of an imaginary prolongation of
the poverty of real social activity, still largely felt as a unitary
condition. The modern spectacle, on the contrary, expresses what
society can do, but in this expression the permitted is absolutely
opposed to the possible. The spectacle is the preservation of
unconsciousness within the practical change of the conditions of
existence. It is its own product, and it has made its own rules: it is
a pseudo-sacred entity. It shows what it is: separate power developing
in itself, in the growth of productivity by means of the incessant
refinement of the division of labor into a parcellization of gestures
which are then dominated by the independent movement of machines; and
working for an ever-expanding market. All community and all critical
sense are dissolved during this movement in which the forces that could
grow by separating are not yet reunited.</p>
<h5>26.</h5>
<p>With the generalized separation of the worker and his products,
every unitary view of accomplished activity and all direct personal
communication among producers are lost. Accompanying the progress of
accumulation of separate products and the concentration of the
productive process, unity and communication become the exclusive
attribute of the system&#8217;s management. The success of the economic
system of separation is the proletarianization of the world.</p>
<h5>27.</h5>
<p>Due to the success of separate production as production of the
separate, the fundamental experience which in primitive societies is
attached to a central task is in the process of being displaced, at the
crest of the system&#8217;s development. by non-work, by inactivity. But this
inactivity is in no way liberated from productive activity: it depends
on productive activity and is an uneasy and admiring submission to the
necessities and results of production; it is itself a product of its
rationality. There can be no freedom outside of activity, and in the
context of the spectacle all activity is negated. just as real activity
has been captured in its entirety for the global construction of this
result. Thus the present &#8220;liberation from labor,&#8221; the increase of
leisure, is in no way a liberation within labor, nor a liberation from
the world shaped by this labor. None of the activity lost in labor can
be regained in the submission to its result.</p>
<h5>28.</h5>
<p>The economic system founded on isolation is a circular production of
isolation. The technology is based on isolation, and the technical
process isolates in turn. From the automobile to television, all the
goods selected by the spectacular system are also its weapons for a
constant reinforcement of the conditions of isolation of &#8220;lonely
crowds.&#8221; The spectacle constantly rediscovers its own assumptions more
concretely.</p>
<h5>29.</h5>
<p>The spectacle originates in the loss of the unity of the world, and
the gigantic expansion of the modern spectacle expresses the totality
of this loss: the abstraction of all specific labor and the general
abstraction of the entirety of production are perfectly rendered in the
spectacle, whose mode of being concrete is precisely abstraction. In
the spectacle, one part of the world represents itself to the world and
is superior to it. The spectacle is nothing more than the common
language of this separation. What binds the spectators together is no
more than an irreversible relation at the very center which maintains
their isolation. The spectacle reunites the separate, but reunites it
as separate.</p>
<h5>30.</h5>
<p>The alienation of the spectator to the profit of the contemplated
object (which is the result of his own unconscious activity) is
expressed in the following way: the more he contemplates the less he
lives; the more he accepts recognizing himself in the dominant images
of need, the less he understands his own existence and his own desires.
The externality of the spectacle in relation to the active man appears
in the fact that his own gestures are no longer his but those of
another who represents them to him. This is why the spectator feels at
home nowhere, because the spectacle is everywhere.</p>
<h5>31.</h5>
<p>The worker does not produce himself; he produces an independent
power. The success of this production, its abundance, returns to the
producer as an abundance of dispossession. All the time and space of
his world become foreign to him with the accumulation of his alienated
products. The spectacle is the map of this new world, a map which
exactly covers its territory. The very powers which escaped us show
themselves to us in all their force.</p>
<h5>32.</h5>
<p>The spectacle within society corresponds to a concrete manufacture
of alienation. Economic expansion is mainly the expansion of this
specific industrial production. What grows with the economy in motion
for itself can only be the very alienation which was at its origin.</p>
<h5>33.</h5>
<p>Separated from his product, man himself produces all the details of
his world with ever increasing power, and thus finds himself ever more
separated from his world. The more his life is now his product, the
more he is separated from his life.</p>
<h5>34.</h5>
<p>The spectacle is capital to such a degree of accumulation that it
becomes an image.</p>
